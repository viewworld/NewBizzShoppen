    And User jon@lajoie.ca with role supplier is big buyer
    And lead Printers ultimate deal exists within category Computers
    And I am on the home page
    And I sign in as jon@lajoie.ca with password secret
    And I go to leads
    And I follow category "Computers"
    And I follow translated "leads.index.buy_lead"
    And I follow translated "layout.main_menu.customer.invoices"
    And I follow translated "customer.invoices.index.view.pending_leads"
    Then I should see "1" rows in a table with headers within "#not_invoiced_leads"
