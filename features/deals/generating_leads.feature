    And user buyer@nbs.com with role supplier exists with attributes "company_name:Xeper"
    And user "buyer@nbs.com" has assigned role "deal_maker"
    Then a deal is created by "buyer@nbs.com" for user "buyer@nbs.com" and category "Business deals" with attributes "header:super|description:super|hidden_description:super|start_date:2011-01-01|end_date:2016-12-12|company_name:starks"

    And template named "Computer details2" is mandatory
    And template named "Computer details2" has following fields "field #1:true:true,field #2:true:false,field #3:false:false"
    Then I follow translated "layout.main_menu.lead_supplier.my_deals"
    Then I follow translated "deals.common.listing.view.new_deal"
    Then I fill deal creation form
    And I fill in "deal_header" with "Templates deal test"
    And I check "deal_published"
