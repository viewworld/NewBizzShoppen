  Scenario: Searching should be across all categories (remove the checkboxes in adv search) and should include fields like name, description, company name
#    When Deal category Primo is created
#    And a deal named "DealInPrimo" exists within category "Primo"
#    And Deal category Secundo is created
#    And a deal named "DealInSecundo" exists within category "Secundo"
#    And I am on browse deals
#    And I follow category "Primo"
#    Then I should see "DealInPrimo"
#    And I should not see "DealInSecundo"
#    And I should be on browse Primo deals
#    When I fill in "search_with_keyword" with "DealIn"
#    And I press "Search"
#    Then I should see "DealInPrimo"
#    And I should see "DealInSecundo"
#    And I open page in browser
#    And I should be on deals
