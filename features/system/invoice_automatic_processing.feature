Feature: Invoice automatic processing

Background:
  Given I am on the homepage
  And I make sure current locale is "en"

@_done @_tested_elsewhere
Scenario: Invoice should have invoice lines automatically generated for all non-paid leads for given user when created manually

@_done @_tested_elsewhere
Scenario: Automatically generated invoice lines are linked to leads bought

@_done @_deprecated
Scenario: Invoice is automatically generated after user goes to checkout

@_done @_deprecated
Scenario: Invoice is not automatically generated for big buyers (do big buyers use paypal to pay??)

@_tested @_done
Scenario: Invoice lines are marked as paid after payment has been processed by paypal
  Given I have user with email gerard.jones@paerson22.com and role supplier
  And an user with role lead_user and email lead_user.jones@paerson22.com exists as subaccount for customer gerard.jones@paerson22.com
  And lead Monitors deal exists within category Computers
  And lead Monitors deal is bought by user gerard.jones@paerson22.com with role supplier and is assigned to user lead_user.jones@paerson22.com with role lead_user
  And user with email "gerard.jones@paerson22.com" and role "supplier" has invoice for lead "Monitors deal" and transaction created by paypal
  Then invoice lines for last invoice are paid for user with email "gerard.jones@paerson22.com" and role "supplier"

@_done @_tested
Scenario: Invoice lines are marked as paid after invoice has been marked as paid by administrator (multiple types of  “payment” object)
