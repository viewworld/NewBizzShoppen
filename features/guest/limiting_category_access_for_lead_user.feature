Feature: Limiting category access for lead user

Scenario: I should be able to see "Restrict requests/purchases from categories" frame in subaccounts edit page

Scenario: "Allow requests/purchases from categories" should list all categories with checkboxes next to them (not checked by default)

Scenario: I should be able to select 0..* categories, that I wish my lead user will not have access to

Scenario: Every change to catgories restrictions should be saved
